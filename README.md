SerialPop is a tiny C# system tray app that shows pop-ups when serial ports are connected or disconnected to/from the machine.

USAGE:
1) Run SerialPop.exe, it will appear in your system tray
1.1) It's a good idea to configure the taskbar to always show it
1.2) Another good idea would be to have it run during startup

2) Whenever a serial port appears or disappears you'll get a toast notification with the details

3) Right-click on the taskbar icons to see all the currently connected serial ports
